Updates from deliverable 1 to deliverable 2

-Modified pitch detection function to take sound frames directly
from microphone stream, rather than from a saved wav file.

-Made the whole game with goombas and coins scrolling across screen.

-Background/all of the mario images found on google image search.

-Added delta graphics.

-Mario can occupy any line or space to catch or avoid coins/goombas.
