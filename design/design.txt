For my term project I created a mario themed game in which the user
whistles at different frequencies to control the character.

In order to analyze the frequencies of the pitches the user inputs,
I used the pyAudio library to play a wav file as well as to open a
stream of data from your microphone. I then used NumPy to carry out
the fast fourier transform algorithm to convert this data into
a frequency. With the frequency, I was able to carry out different
actions, such as movement.

I used object oriented programming to handle movement and collision,
so I had a variety of different classes corresponding to the different
objects in my game.

I used Tkinter to handle mouse events, key events, and draw the
interface. I implemented delta graphics, since I used
many large images which would be costly to draw constantly.

Regarding the UI, my game starts with a simple start screen with
a "play game" button and an "instructions" button. I found that
having instructions makes grasping the controls easier.
Additionally, I have a button within my instructions screen which
will reads a wav file that plays an F Major scale. I included this
so the user can get all of the pitches in their ear before playing
the game.

In the actual game screen, I have icons and counters for lives
remaining, coins collected, fire flowers stored, and the last note
detected, which all assist the user in playing the game.

Finally, I had a pause screen, game over screen, and you win screen.
The pause screen is simply there if the user wants to take a break 
or if they want to re-read the controls or gameplay instructions.
